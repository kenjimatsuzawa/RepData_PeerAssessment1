## Loading and preprocessing the data
First load activity.csv data to the object called "activity" and look at the dimentions of data and see first few lines of data.
```{r}
activity <- read.csv("./activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep=",")
dim(activity)
head(activity)
```
activity <- read.csc()


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
To calculate the average steps per day, first store total steps to the totalstep object and store the number of days to the numdays object.
```{r}
totalstep <- sum(activity$steps, na.rm=TRUE)
numdays <- length(unique(activity$date))
averagestep <- totalstep / numdays
print(averagestep)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
